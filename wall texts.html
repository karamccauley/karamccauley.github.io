    <h1>Influential Art Pieces</h1>
    <h3>Bernini, <span class="italic">David</span>, 1623</h3>
   <img src="../assets/David.jpeg" alt="..." class="right">

    <p class="body">Bernini was a prominent Italian Baroque artist. He sculpted the biblical David, not in repose, but actively fighting Goliath. David is in action, slinging his stone. His face shows intensity and effort: he is in the peak of action, emphasizing the human experience. Michaelangelo’s High Renaissance sculpture depicts David resting and languid after the battle, in the perfect ideal moment. Bernini wants the audience to see the work, the fear, the physical drain, and, ultimately, the hardship of battle. David's body is twisted, which creates an off-center composition that draws the viewers into the drama of the action. Bernini’s David takes a famous moment of history and makes it come alive.

    <p class="body">During the 1600s, the Protestant Reformation had caused Protestants to deemphasize art, even to the point of destroying it. They justified this by saying art was a form of idolatry and promoted tradition instead of pure scripture and doctrine. Italy, still very Catholic, responded by making art that was even more emotive and dynamic than it had been in the Renaissance. The point was to have the audience relate to the action and drama captured in the art. Baroque art emphasized that people can experience what is being shown in the piece. It encouraged people to go out and face the intense emotional aspects of life.

    <h3>Caravaggio, <span class="italic">Crucifixion of St. Peter</span>, 1601</h3>
        <img src="../assets/Caravaggio.jpg" alt="..." class="right">

        <p class="body">Caravaggio was a major figure in the Italian Baroque movement, known for his unique style in the seventeenth century, particularly for a new-found realism (Heyl). When he depicted the apostle Peter, for example, being crucified upside down, he showed Peter feeling strain and distress so the audience feels the intensity of the moment. Caravaggio also shows Peter as an aged man with pale, loose skin, showing that even an apostle deals with the ravages of time. Here is a Christian man being put to death because of his religion. 
        </p>

        <p class="body">This is an example of how Baroque art impacts and speaks to viewers. It asks a challenging question: would the viewer be willing to be put to death for faith? Caravaggio does an excellent job in capturing this. He doesn't paint the pretty picture of the ideal moment, but the hardship and pain during this time period. Caravaggio's name has become synonymous with a reform movement towards “the normative and reasonable, the human and the inward" (Heyl).
        </p>

        <p class="body">Caravaggio's style and his honest realism is important because it connects with the audience on a more profound level. It's more powerful and allows people to see the reality of the moment and how history and this time period really was like, rather than only showing the ideal moments. History includes events, horrific in nature, but lessons to be learned that art can capture and share with the modern world.

    <h3>Francisco de Zurburan, <span class="italic">St Serapion</span>, 1628 </h3>
        <img src="../assets/St Serpion.jpeg" alt="..." class="right">

        <p class="body">This depiction of St Serapion introduces Spanish Baroque art, which primarily focuses on individual suffering. Francisco de Zurburan illustrates this worn out and battered saint about to be four quartered. St Serapion was a Mercedian friar involved in rescuing Catholics from Muslim captivity. On the last prisoner exchange, St Serapion was captured and put to death. This painting is particularly evocative because of its emotional power: gazing at the exhausted face of St Serapion brings feelings of sorrow and despair. The viewers immediately feel the pathos of this man being persecuted for his beliefs. This calls attention to how the audience can connect with an artwork and feel the pain through the painting. This was a dramatic difference between the Renaissance and Baroque periods because Renaissance art was not as raw and emotional. 
        </p>

        <p class="body"> Some scholars argue that Baroque has returned as a reflection of modern times (Van Tuinen). Baroque art is all about depicting difficult emotions and humanity in its real form. As Baroque art sought dignity in reality, so modern society seeks the goodness in being flawed, aged, and strained. To show that art doesn’t have to be idolatry, but something people can connect to. It allows people to see that being human in a society involves suffering, hardship, conflict, violence, and persecution.

    <h3>Peter Paul Rubens, <span class="italic">Consequences of War</span>, 1638-9</h3>
        <img src="../assets/Rubens.jpeg" alt="..." class="right">

        <p class="body">Peter Paul Rubens was a famous Flemish Baroque artist. He introduced a unique new style - known as Rubenesque - that portrayed women as more plump and round. As one critic wrote, Rubens’ “female type is above all characterized by specific physical qualities, which tend to be summarized as ‘fleshy’ and ‘corpulent" (De Clippel).
        </p>

        <p class="body"> In <span class="italic">Consequences of War</span>, Rubens focuses on Venus, the goddess of love and beauty. Rubens shows her trying to restrain her husband, Aeries, the god of war, from engaging in carnage and destruction. Rubens’s message is that once the horror of war begins, even love has much difficulty in reining it in. The painting’s dynamic movement sweeps to the right with Aeries, showing powerful momentum. Knowledge, culture, lives, music, stories, and history are trampled under the feet of war. 
        </p>

        <p class="body">The painting is not just a commentary on war's terrors, it is also a movement away from religious subjects and towards humanism. His depiction of the goddess of beauty as a realistically crafted woman, rather than an unnaturally slender, elongated figure celebrates real humanity. Rubens valued elegance and uprightness in the female form, but he also valued the everyday woman’s form: not perfect, but beautifully real. This mirrored the social and cultural norms then in place (De Clippel). This idea suggests that Rubens early on introduced the idea of body positivity, contradicting the so-called ‘norm’ of the female figure created by Renaissance paintings.
