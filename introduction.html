<h1>The Post Renaissance World Discovering Itself</h1>

<p class="body">Baroque art - the word “baroque” means misshapen pearl or bold ornamentation - was a dramatic shift from idealism to realism in the seventeenth century (Merriam-Webster). Following the period of the High Renaissance, when artistic subjects were often idealized, stable, and clear in composition, Baroque art showed an explosion of theatricality, motion, and energy that tried to capture the climax of a moment. It displayed intense emotion and attempted to convey a deeper message to humanity. 
</p>

<p class="body">The Baroque artistic movement started as a Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation. Protestant art tended to be simple and unornamented, so the Catholic Church responded with extravagantly ornamented art in the Counter Reformation. The Council of Trent, a series of theological conferences held in Trento, Italy between 1545 and 1563, was the Catholic Church’s response to the challenges posed by the Protestant Reformation. The pope and the curia used the Council to clarify Catholic doctrine and to adjust policy.

<p class="body">However, this period became more than just a response to a religious movement: it became a pivotal point in society that saw humans develop a deep connection with artistic subjects. The Baroque movement “became the first visual style to have a significant worldwide impact" (Victoria and Albert Museum).
</p>

<p class="body">The most visually evident shift from the High Renaissance to Baroque was the change in how the human figure was depicted. The human body was more realistically portrayed - with sweat and tears - and less idealized. The energetic human form “helped turn the work into a drama to convey particular messages and to engage the emotions of the viewer" (Victoria and Albert Museum). Many Baroque pieces include suffering, struggling, and tribulation that invite viewers to connect emotionally with the piece. Though some High Renaissance paintings incorporated this idea as well, Baroque art in particular allowed people viewing the pictures to recognize themselves in the piece. 
</p>

<p class="body">Baroque artists such as Caravaggio, Bernini, and Rubens represented humans as really human, not perfectly muscled Greek gods. Caravaggio showed his figures as weathered, old, and exhausted. Bernini showed his figures in motion, facing the worries and fears of life. Rubens may even have started the early body positivity movement by showing figures that were not lean and muscled but realistically rotund. Overall, Baroque art is all about showing the reality of the world where people can relate to it and feel a part of it. Life is a balance; there is both hardship and beauty in the world.
